# Easiest Installation method
1. Insert SD Card into the reader on your PC
2. Download animation folder(s)
3. Drag and drop folder(s) into sd/dolphin
4. Edit manifest.txt located in sd/dolphin
```
name: <FOLDER_NAME>
Min butthurt: 0
Max butthurt: 14
Min level: 1
Max level: 30

```
- "FOLDER NAME" is the name of the animations folder. (change according of course)
- "Max level" adjust to max level if on custom firmware. (ie. 30, 15 etc)
- "Weight" the higher the weight the higher the chance the animation will show up before other animations.
 
 5. Save file, eject SD, put SD in flipper, and reboot! All done!
